What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning provides us a statistical tools to explore and do analysis about that particular data.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.
Machine Learning is the process by which a machine learns from examples (data) and improves its performance over time.

In ML we have three different approaches/models:
1) Supervised ML
2) Unsupervised ML
3) Reinforcement (semi supervised) ML

1) Supervised Learning ‚Äì In Supervised learning, we will be having a labeled data (past data) and with this kind of data we will be actually will be able to do the prediction for the future.
What Do You Mean by a Dataset?
A dataset is simply a collection of data that is used for training, testing, or analyzing in computer programs ‚Äî especially in machine learning.
 
In Simple Words:
A dataset is like a big table (or spreadsheet) filled with examples that a computer can learn from.

In Supervised ML we have past labeled data.
Algorithms:
    ‚Ä¢ Linear Regression
    ‚Ä¢ Logistic Regression
    ‚Ä¢ Decision Trees
    ‚Ä¢ Support Vector Machines
    ‚Ä¢ Neural Networks

Neural network you can find in both ML and DL:
ML ‚Äì with 1 or 2 hidden layer for simple tasks
DL ‚Äì Many hidden layers for complex task.

2) Unsupervised ML ‚Äì Here, we will not be having any labeled data, that means in my data set we will not know what is the output.
In this ML model we usually solved clustering kind of problems.
What do you mean by clustering?
Based on the similarity of the data, it will try to group the data together. 
Algorithms:
    ‚Ä¢ K-Means Clustering
    ‚Ä¢ Hierarchical Clustering
    ‚Ä¢ DB scan clustering

3) Reinforcement Learning ‚Äì Some part of data will be labeled and some part of data will not be labeled so the ML model learns slowly by seeing the past data and it will be learning as soon as new data will be coming up. 
Algorithms:
    ‚Ä¢ Q-learning
    ‚Ä¢ Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
    ‚Ä¢ Policy Gradient methods

CLASSIFICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING
    ‚Ä¢ Supervised Learning
    ‚Ä¢ Unsupervised Learning
    ‚Ä¢ Reinforcement Learning

---------
Supervised ML : Prediction, recommendation,classification
Unsupervised ML: Clustering (grouping), association learning

Reinforcement Learning: Gaming (you vs computer )
 Learn from environment, Video games ‚Äì in which computer system learns from your movement.
Robotics ‚Äì Training robots to walk, pick objects, or perform assembly tasks.

Supervised Learning ‚Äì Learning while being guided.
The system learns from examples that already have the correct answers (labels), so it knows exactly what it should predict.

Unsupervised Learning ‚Äì Learning by exploring.
The system learns from data without any correct answers given, finding patterns and groupings on its own.


Reinforcement Learning is a way for a computer or machine to learn by trial and error, getting rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones, so it can figure out the best way to reach a goal.

"Reinforcement Learning is nothing but learning while doing ‚Äî the system learns by taking actions, seeing the results, and adjusting its behavior to get better rewards over time."


Advantages of Machine Learning (Simple Words)
    1. Finds patterns quickly
‚Äì ML can analyze lots of data and discover patterns that humans might miss.
    2. Works automatically
‚Äì Once trained, it can make decisions or predictions without human help.
    3. Keeps getting better
‚Äì ML improves over time as it learns from more data.
    4. Handles complex data
‚Äì It can deal with large, multi-dimensional, and varied data (numbers, text, images, etc.).
    5. Used everywhere
‚Äì ML is applied in many fields: healthcare, finance, telecom, retail, self-driving cars, and more.

In short: Machine Learning saves time, improves accuracy, handles big/complex data, and keeps learning on its own.

Disadvantages of Machine Learning (Simple Words)
    1. Needs a lot of data
‚Äì ML works best when it has huge amounts of data, which is not always easy to get.
    2. Takes time and money
‚Äì Training ML models requires powerful computers and can be expensive.
    3. Hard to understand results
‚Äì Sometimes the model gives answers, but it‚Äôs difficult to explain ‚Äúwhy‚Äù it made that decision.
    4. Can make mistakes
‚Äì If the data is wrong, biased, or incomplete, ML can give incorrect or unfair results.
	

üëâ In short: ML is powerful, but it needs lots of good data, resources, and care‚Äîotherwise, it can be slow, costly, and sometimes wrong.
