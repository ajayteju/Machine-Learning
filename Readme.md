Lifecycle of ML:

1) clean data : 100 , 80 – train, 20 - test
2) understand nature of data
3) choose you ML algo
4) Split the data into training and testing set
5) train the algo
6) Understand the pattern
7) logic/program
8) New data
9) Automatically predict/classify on the basis of pre-training


What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence focused on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. So, instead of relying on your instructions, ML systems learn from data and improve their performance over time through experience.

The process typically requires you to feed large amounts of data into a machine learning algorithm. Typically, a data scientist builds, refines, and deploys your models. However, with the rise of AutoML (automated machine learning), data analysts can now perform these tasks if the model is not too complex.

The ML algorithm analyzes and identifies patterns, relationships, and trends within the data and then uses these insights to build a mathematical model that can make predictions, can power predictive analytics, or take actions when presented with new, unseen data.

Key ML techniques:

    Supervised Learning: Training a model using labeled data, where the desired output is known, to predict or classify new unseen examples.

    Unsupervised Learning: Discovering patterns and structures within unlabeled data without explicit guidance.

    Semi-Supervised Learning: Combining labeled and unlabeled data to train a model, leveraging both supervised and unsupervised techniques.

    Reinforcement Learning: Teaching an agent to learn optimal behaviors by receiving rewards or punishments based on its actions in an environment.

    Transfer Learning: Utilizing knowledge learned from one task or domain to improve performance on a different but related task or domain.

    Deep Learning: Employing neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns and representations from data.

    Ensemble Learning: Combining multiple models to make predictions or decisions, often resulting in improved accuracy and robustness.

    Active Learning: Interactively selecting and labeling the most informative data instances for training, optimizing the learning process.

    Online Learning: Continuously updating and refining a model as new data arrives in a sequential manner.

    Feature Engineering: Transforming and selecting relevant features from raw data to improve the performance and interpretability of models.

Machine learning has a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, prescriptive analytics, and autonomous vehicles. It plays a crucial role in enabling AI systems to adapt, improve, and perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention.

Machine Learning provides us a statistical tools to explore and do analysis about that particular data.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.
Machine Learning is the process by which a machine learns from examples (data) and improves its performance over time.

In ML we have three different approaches/models:
1) Supervised ML
2) Unsupervised ML
3) Reinforcement (semi supervised) ML

1) Supervised Learning – In Supervised learning, we will be having a labeled data (past data) and with this kind of data we will be actually will be able to do the prediction for the future.
What Do You Mean by a Dataset?
A dataset is simply a collection of data that is used for training, testing, or analyzing in computer programs — especially in machine learning.
 
In Simple Words:
A dataset is like a big table (or spreadsheet) filled with examples that a computer can learn from.

In Supervised ML we have past labeled data.
Algorithms:
    • Linear Regression
    • Logistic Regression
    • Decision Trees
    • Support Vector Machines
    • Neural Networks

Neural network you can find in both ML and DL:
ML – with 1 or 2 hidden layer for simple tasks
DL – Many hidden layers for complex task.

2) Unsupervised ML – Here, we will not be having any labeled data, that means in my data set we will not know what is the output.
In this ML model we usually solved clustering kind of problems.
What do you mean by clustering?
Based on the similarity of the data, it will try to group the data together. 
Algorithms:
    • K-Means Clustering
    • Hierarchical Clustering
    • DB scan clustering

3) Reinforcement Learning – Some part of data will be labeled and some part of data will not be labeled so the ML model learns slowly by seeing the past data and it will be learning as soon as new data will be coming up. 
Algorithms:
    • Q-learning
    • Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
    • Policy Gradient methods

CLASSIFICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING
    • Supervised Learning
    • Unsupervised Learning
    • Reinforcement Learning

---------
Supervised ML : Prediction, recommendation,classification
Unsupervised ML: Clustering (grouping), association learning

Reinforcement Learning: Gaming (you vs computer )
 Learn from environment, Video games – in which computer system learns from your movement.
Robotics – Training robots to walk, pick objects, or perform assembly tasks.

Supervised Learning – Learning while being guided.
The system learns from examples that already have the correct answers (labels), so it knows exactly what it should predict.

Unsupervised Learning – Learning by exploring.
The system learns from data without any correct answers given, finding patterns and groupings on its own.


Reinforcement Learning is a way for a computer or machine to learn by trial and error, getting rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones, so it can figure out the best way to reach a goal.

"Reinforcement Learning is nothing but learning while doing — the system learns by taking actions, seeing the results, and adjusting its behavior to get better rewards over time."


Advantages of Machine Learning (Simple Words)
    1. Finds patterns quickly
– ML can analyze lots of data and discover patterns that humans might miss.
    2. Works automatically
– Once trained, it can make decisions or predictions without human help.
    3. Keeps getting better
– ML improves over time as it learns from more data.
    4. Handles complex data
– It can deal with large, multi-dimensional, and varied data (numbers, text, images, etc.).
    5. Used everywhere
– ML is applied in many fields: healthcare, finance, telecom, retail, self-driving cars, and more.

In short: Machine Learning saves time, improves accuracy, handles big/complex data, and keeps learning on its own.

Disadvantages of Machine Learning (Simple Words)
    1. Needs a lot of data
– ML works best when it has huge amounts of data, which is not always easy to get.
    2. Takes time and money
– Training ML models requires powerful computers and can be expensive.
    3. Hard to understand results
– Sometimes the model gives answers, but it’s difficult to explain “why” it made that decision.
    4. Can make mistakes
– If the data is wrong, biased, or incomplete, ML can give incorrect or unfair results.
	

👉 In short: ML is powerful, but it needs lots of good data, resources, and care—otherwise, it can be slow, costly, and sometimes wrong.
