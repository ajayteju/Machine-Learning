What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning provides us a statistical tools to explore and do analysis about that particular data.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.
Machine Learning is the process by which a machine learns from examples (data) and improves its performance over time.

In ML we have three different approaches/models:
1) Supervised ML
2) Unsupervised ML
3) Reinforcement (semi supervised) ML

1) Supervised Learning – In Supervised learning, we will be having a labeled data (past data) and with this kind of data we will be actually will be able to do the prediction for the future.
What Do You Mean by a Dataset?
A dataset is simply a collection of data that is used for training, testing, or analyzing in computer programs — especially in machine learning.
 
In Simple Words:
A dataset is like a big table (or spreadsheet) filled with examples that a computer can learn from.

In Supervised ML we have past labeled data.
Algorithms:
    • Linear Regression
    • Logistic Regression
    • Decision Trees
    • Support Vector Machines
    • Neural Networks

Neural network you can find in both ML and DL:
ML – with 1 or 2 hidden layer for simple tasks
DL – Many hidden layers for complex task.

2) Unsupervised ML – Here, we will not be having any labeled data, that means in my data set we will not know what is the output.
In this ML model we usually solved clustering kind of problems.
What do you mean by clustering?
Based on the similarity of the data, it will try to group the data together. 
Algorithms:
    • K-Means Clustering
    • Hierarchical Clustering
    • DB scan clustering

3) Reinforcement Learning – Some part of data will be labeled and some part of data will not be labeled so the ML model learns slowly by seeing the past data and it will be learning as soon as new data will be coming up. 
Algorithms:
    • Q-learning
    • Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
    • Policy Gradient methods
